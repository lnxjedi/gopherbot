# Configuring Gopherbot

> NOTE: This chapter has not been updated for **Gopherbot** version 2, but has reference material that may be of use when examining default and standard configuration.

**Gopherbot** has very powerful and flexible configuration capabilities based on *yaml* templates. The core concept is simple; **Gopherbot** ships with default configuration in the `conf/` directory of the installation archive, and individual robots can modify and override the default configuration with environment variables and custom configuration files. This chapter examines the configuration system in detail.
