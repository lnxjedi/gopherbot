# Installation

There are two distinct pieces to any given robot:

* The **Gopherbot** distribution archive, normally in `/opt/gopherbot`, providing the `gopherbot` binary, default configuration, and a wide assortment of included batteries (libraries, plugins, jobs, tasks, helper scripts and more)
* The configuration for a specific robot stored in the robot's `$GOPHER_HOME`; the gopherbot binary is run from here to start your robot

This short chapter discusses the distribution archive and it's requirements.
