# Installation

There are three distinct tasks involved in installing and running a **Gopherbot** robot:

* This chapter discusses installing the **Gopherbot** distribution archive, normally in `/opt/gopherbot`, providing the `gopherbot` binary, default configuration, and an assortment of included batteries (libraries, plugins, jobs, tasks, helper scripts and more); if you're using a [Gopherbot container](https://hub.docker.com/r/lnxjedi/gopherbot), this is essentially a no-op.
* Configuring a runnable instance of a robot for your team; the included **setup** plugin should make this an "easy button" - discussed in the chapter on [Initial Configuration](RobotInstall.md).
* Deploying and running your robot on a server, VM, or in a container - covered in the chapter on [Running your Robot](RunRobot.md).
