# Installation

There are two distinct pieces to any given robot:

* The **Gopherbot** distribution archive, normally in `/opt/gopherbot` providing the `gopherbot` binary, default configuration, and a wide assortment of included batteries (libraries, plugins, jobs, tasks, helper scripts and more). This short chapter discusses the software install and requirements.

* Configuration for a specific robot - configuring and running your robot(s) is the topic of most of the other chapters
