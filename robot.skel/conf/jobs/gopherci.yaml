## Sample configuration for triggering GopherCI builds
## from the GitHub integration. You'll need to replace
## <FIXME> with the channel where notifications are sent,
## and possibly replace the value for User:
## If notifications go to multiple channels, add entries
## to the Triggers array.
# HistoryLogs: 14
# Quiet: true
# Triggers:
# - User: github
#   Channel: <FIXME>
#   Regex: 'new commit.*(github.com\/.*)\/tree\/(.*)\|'
