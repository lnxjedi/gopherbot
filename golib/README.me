## readline

Local fork of `github.com/chzyer/readline` (v1.5.1).

Changes from upstream:
- Emit synthetic rune markers for bracketed paste start/end (ESC[200~/ESC[201~) so connectors can detect paste mode without reimplementing terminal parsing.

Rationale:
- The SSH connector needs to detect bracketed paste boundaries to implement paste-aware multi-line input while still relying on readline's rendering/line editing.

Upstream source:
- Copied from module cache at `/home/david/go/pkg/mod/github.com/chzyer/readline@v1.5.1`.
