- Hard refuse to proceed with any task unless the current git branch starts with "codex-". If HEAD is detached or not a git repo, stop and ask.
- Before making code changes, read AGENTS.md and then read all files under aidocs/ (recursively) to orient.
- Files matched by .gitignore are still informative; do not ignore them.
- When this repo lives inside a parent that also contains sibling repos (gopherbot-doc, bishop-gopherbot), treat those siblings as in-scope for read/write. If you enter a sibling repo, first locate and follow its AGENTS.md or .codex instructions.
