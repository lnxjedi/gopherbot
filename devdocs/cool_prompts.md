# COOL Prompts

This works pretty well from gopherbot/:
```
Please read aidocs/README.md and follow the Required Orientation documents to assist yourself in this task. I’ve started the default robot (floyd) in ../empty-test with --aidev. Use the .mcp-connect file in that directory for the robot ID and connection info, then use gopherbot-mcp iteratively to connect to the robot, say “floyd, tell me a knock-knock joke” in the "general" channel, complete the flow, and rate the joke.
