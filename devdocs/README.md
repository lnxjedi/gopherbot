# DevDocs - Human-Readable Documentation for Contributors

Documentation here is meant for human consumption, as opposed to `aidocs/`, meant for use when 'onboarding' an AI for new PRs.

## Contents

- `devdocs/testing.md` - how to run tests and what they cover
- `devdocs/UPGRADING-v3.md` - migration notes for existing robots moving to v3 multi-protocol behavior
- `devdocs/new-robot-onboarding-epic.md` - planning slices and guardrails for the v3 onboarding epic
