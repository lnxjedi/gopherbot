- Look up new Bot IDs on the fly if a new bot ID is seen; need to add locking of the bots[] map
- Move slack send loop into anon func in Run
- Fix slack user attribute == user
- Use globalLock for protocolConfig, brainConfig, elevateConfig

For testing:
- Emit error values to channel for testing:
 - When a user is ignored
 - When auth/elevate fails
 - When a command doesn't match anything (wrong user / channel or typo)
- Create comprehensive test loop / table tests
- Add SendBotMessage() and GetBotMessage() methods for Slack in a conditional
  compilation connector_testing.go ala GetEvents - see emit_testing.go; use for
  connecting to slack and immediately quitting
- Documentation for events, emit, development and testing - Developing.md
- Unit tests for updateRegexes
- Auth & elevator should trust using plugins (or trust all)
- Stop hard-coding 'it' for contexts; 'server:it:the server' instead of
  'server', (context followed by generics that match); e.g. "reboot server",
  "reboot the server", "reboot it" would all check the "server" short-term
  memory to get e.g. "webtest1.example.com"
- Add more sample transcripts to documentation using the terminal connector
- The 'catchall' plugin should be in gopherbot.yaml (There Can Be Only One)
