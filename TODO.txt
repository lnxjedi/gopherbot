- Look up new Bot IDs on the fly if a new bot ID is seen; need to add locking of the bots[] map
- Move slack send loop into anon func in Run
- Fix slack user attribute == user
- Use globalLock for protocolConfig, brainConfig, elevateConfig

For testing:
- Emit error values to channel for testing:
 - When a user is ignored
 - When auth/elevate fails
 - When a command doesn't match anything (wrong user / channel or typo)
- Create comprehensive test loop / table tests
- Add SendBotMessage() and GetBotMessage() methods for Slack in a conditional compilation connector_testing.go ala GetEvents - see emit_testing.go; use for
  connecting to slack and immediately quitting
- Documentation for events, emit, development and testing - Developing.md
- Unit tests for updateRegexes
