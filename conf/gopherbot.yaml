## This is a the default configuration for gopherbot. Values here can be
## overridden by values in the custom configuration. Primarily configuration
## required on initial load is defined here; most configuration, as well as
## locally defined job/task/plugin scripts, should come from a custom
## configuration repository.

## Template functions:
## default "value":
##   provide a default value if "" or unset is piped in
## env "ENV_VAR":
##   look a value up from the environment
## decrypt "<encrypted string>":
##   decrypt a value encrypted with the 'encrypt <string>' command
## .Include "<filename>":
##   Include and expand the contents of another file from the same
##   location (installed defaults or custom config)

## Port to listen on for http/JSON api calls, for external plugins.
## By default, automatically choose a port.
LocalPort: {{ env "GOPHER_PORT" | default "0" }}

{{ $proto := env "GOPHER_PROTOCOL" | default "nullconn" }}
Protocol: {{ $proto }}

## Trivial "terminal" connector config for a single admin user.
## This pulls in a basic default config for the terminal connector
## which can be overridden in custom if desired.
{{ if eq $proto "terminal" }}
{{ .Include "terminal.yaml" }}
{{ end }}

EncryptBrain: true

## Configure log level
LogLevel: {{ env "GOPHER_LOGLEVEL" | default "info" }}

TimeZone: {{ env "GOPHER_TIMEZONE" | default "America/New_York" }}
