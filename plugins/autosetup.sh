and to add yourself as an administrator:
1) Add a read-write deploy key to the robot's repository, using the the 'manage_key.pub' \
shown above; this corresponds to an encrypted 'manage_key' that your robot will use to save \
and update it's configuration. 
2) Add a read-only deploy key to the robot's repository, using the 'deploy_key.pub' shown \
above; this corresponds to an unencrypted 'deploy_key' (file removed) which is trivially \
encoded as the 'GOPHER_DEPLOY_KEY' in the '.env' file. *Gopherbot* will use this deploy key, \
along with the 'GOPHER_CUSTOM_REPOSITORY', to initially clone it's repository during bootstrapping.
3) Copy the contents of the '.env' file shown above to a safe place, not kept in a repository. \
GOPHER_PROTOCOL is commented out to avoid accidentally connecting another instance of your robot \
to team chat when run from a terminal window. With proper configuration of your git repository, \
the '.env' file is all that's needed to bootstrap your robot in to an empty *Gopherbot* \
container, (https://hub.docker.com/r/lnxjedi/gopherbot) or on a Linux host or VM with the \
*Gopherbot* software archive installed.
4) Once these tasks are complete, copy steps 5-7 below to a temporary text file for reference, \
and press <enter> to restart your robot, which will then connect to your team chat.
5) Invite your robot to #${JOBCHANNEL}; slack robots will need to be invited to any channels \
where they will be listening and/or speaking.
6) Open a direct message (DM) channel to your robot, and give this command to add yourself \
as an administrator: \"add administrator $SETUPKEY\"; your robot will then update \
'custom/conf/slack.yaml' to make you an administrator, and reload it's configuration.
7) Once that completes, you can instruct the robot to store it's configuration in it's git \
repository by issuing the 'save' command.

After your robot has saved it's configuration, press <ctrl-c> to stop this container, which \
can then be discarded.
