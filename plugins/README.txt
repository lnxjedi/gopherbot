This directory has some example external plugins. To activate a plugin
in this directory, it must be listed in the robot's "ExternalPlugins"
configuration item. Note that most of the script plugins that ship with
gopherbot aren't that useful (though most of the Go plugins are). The notable
exception is the weather plugin, weather.rb, which requires configuration.
