This directory has a few useful example script plugins. To activate a plugin
in this directory, it must be listed in the robot's "ExternalScripts"
configuration item, and in some cases require extra configuration in
conf/plugins/<foo>.yaml

The 'samples' directory are mostly used by the testing framework, but are also
useful for code examples.
