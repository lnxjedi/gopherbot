/* Technical notes on the waiter implementation
 - or -
Why retryPrompt is sent to all waiters, instead of just the head of a queue

After spending a good deal of one morning re-writing waiters as a proper queue,
I realized the problem with that implementation. Each script plugin is
posting JSON to a port and waiting for a reply, and most script libraries will
timeout waiting after no more than a minute (which is why the replyTimeout is
45 seconds). If we queue up all waiters, and the user doesn't reply to the first
waiter (or second), then the second waiter in the queue might not get a reply
for a 90 seconds - by which time the script would crash. To be certain that
every waiting plugin gets some kind of return value within 60 seconds, we just
send retryPrompt to all waiters, and let them race to be first.

Realize this isn't as bad as it might seem; the list of waiters is per
user/channel combination, so this kind of thing only happens if a single user
is absolutely going crazy with firing off interactive commands in a single
channel.

The moral of the story: don't bother implementing a queue for reply waiters,
and think hard before doing things any differently.
