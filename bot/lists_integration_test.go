	Be careful with the plugins you're testing, and be sure that the robot
	completes all actions before replying. Consider for instance:

		Say "I'll remember \"$1\" is \"$2\" - but eventually I'll forget!"
		Remember "$1" "$2"

	This order of events means the test may well complete (because it got the
	reply) before actually remembering the fact. The next test, recalling the
	fact, could then fail because it tries to recall the fact before it's
	actually been stored in the previous test.

	I know this because it took me a couple of hours to figure out why my
	test was failing. */
